Notes:

This project was made over a weekend as part of learning Golang. To that end my primary focus for this project was just getting it to work completely. I think the code has a lot of room for improvement when it comes to both effecieny and readability. I don't intend to update the code in anyway unless I find that it is not working as intended. Instead I plan to keep the project as is to serve as a starting point for my skill and expereinces in Go. The final piece of this practice project will come in the form of testing at a later date.
